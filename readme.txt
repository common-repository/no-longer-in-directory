Checks for installed plugins that are no longer in the WordPress.org Plugin Directory.

== Description ==

When a plugin is removed from the WordPress.org Plugin Directory no warning is provided in the WordPress admin area if that plugin is installed in a website. Plugins can be removed for the following reasons:

- they are found to break the GPL
- they are found to break the directory rules
- other plugins by the author are found to be a problem and all are removed pending investigation
- the author asks for it to be closed
- the author asks for it to be closed because they are re-releasing under a different name
- it is being investigated after non-specific complaints
- **there is a security vulnerability**

If the plugin contains a security vulnerability the website could be vulnerable to being exploited until the plugin is deleted from the installation or a security update is released and applied.

If you want WordPress to begin alerting when installed plugins have been removed from the directory please make sure to [vote for implementing that in WordPress](https://wordpress.org/extend/ideas/topic/alert-when-installed-plugins-have-been-removed-from-the-plugin-directory). In the mean time, this plugin adds a page to WordPress to check if any plugins installed in WordPress are on a list of plugins that are no longer in the WordPress.org Plugin Directory so that WordPress administrators are alerted to the issue.

The plugin will also separately list any plugins that have not been updated in the WordPress.org Plugin Directory in over two years.

For removed plugins that have a security vulnerability, a link to a security advisory maybe included in the results of the check.

In the past we have been about the only ones notifying the Plugin Directory of plugins with disclosed vulnerabilities in their current versions, which usually leads them to being removed from the Plugin Directory pending a fix. Due to WordPress' continued poor handling of notifying about removed plugins and other issues, we have [stopped doing that until concrete plans are made to fix two of those issues](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/2017/06/08/taking-a-stand-against-the-continued-poor-handling-of-security-with-wordpress/). With that there is likely to be an increasing number of plugins that remain in the directory despite containing vulnerabilities. So simply keeping your plugins up to date and using this plugin will not keep you protected against vulnerabilities in WordPress plugins at this time. Until WordPress starts to fix those issue, you can get comprehensive monitoring of security vulnerabilities with our [Plugin Vulnerabilities service](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/) (along with other benefits including the [ability to vote/suggest plugins to receive a security review by us](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/wordpress-plugin-security-reviews/)). You can get your first month of the service for free when you use the coupon code "FirstMonthFree" when [signing up](https://www.pluginvulnerabilities.com/product/subscription/).

To insure that plugins that have returned to the WordPress.org Plugin Directory since the list was last updated are not incorrectly warned about, the plugin rechecks the WordPress.org Plugin Directory to confirm any installed plugins that are on the list have not returned to the directory.

The check is done using the plugin's directory (folder) name which could lead to plugins that have never been in the plugin directory to be flagged if they use the same name as a plugin that was in the WordPress.org Plugin Directory. If you become aware of a plugin this happening to please contact us so that we can put a check in place to prevent that from happening anymore.

**Supported Localizations:** Deutsch, Español, Français

Please let us know if you are interested in us adding additional localizations.
